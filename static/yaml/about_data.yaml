  heading_text: WHAT WE DO
  body_text: OSC, built using distributed ledger technologies (a consortium blockchain), 
            allows researchers to provide metadata and verification information about 
            their scientific datasets and update this information as the datasets change 
            and evolve over time in an auditable manner. In simple words, this gives 
            researchers the ability to extend and build upon prior research when they are 
            able to efficiently access, validate, and verify the data referenced.

  heading_text: OUR PORTAL
  body_text: OSC features a web-based portal with user-friendly interfaces for data registration,
            search and verification capability along with client tools to access the platform. 
            Additionally researchers can develop “research workflows” linking data entries in the
            ledger creating an auditable record of the data workflow process behind the research 
            findings.
